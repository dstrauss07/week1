            <h1>I don't understand the question, and I won't respond to it.</h1>
            <p>Well, what do you expect, mother? I hear the jury's still out on science. There's so many poorly chosen words
                in that sentence. There's only one man I've ever called a coward, and that's Brian Doyle Murray. No, what
                I'm calling you is a television actor.</p>
            <p>I'm half machine. I'm a monster.
                <strong> Michael!</strong>
                <em> I'm a monster.</em> I'm a monster.</p>
            <h2>Say goodbye to these, because it's the last time!</h2>
            <p>Michael! We just call it a sausage. Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough. Steve Holt! We just
                call it a sausage.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Marry me.</li>
                <li>It's called 'taking advantage.' It's what gets you ahead in life.</li>
                <li>As you may or may not know, Lindsay and I have hit a bit of a rough patch.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>No, I did not kill Kitty. However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer's questions because I am
                an honest man with no secrets to hide.</h3>
            <p>That's why you always leave a note! It's called 'taking advantage.' It's what gets you ahead in life. As you
                may or may not know, Lindsay and I have hit a bit of a rough patch. I hear the jury's still out on science.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Really? Did nothing cancel?</li>
                <li>First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn't date magicians.</li>
